# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

For this project I used the following data sets from github datasets (from datahub.io), and NOAA:
* [CPI Adjusted United States Billion Dollar Disaster Events](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions/time-series/US/cost)
* [Global Average Surface Temperatures Monthly, and Global Land and Ocean Average Temperature Anomalies](https://github.com/datasets/global-temp)


{Describe your purpose for writing this software to analyze the data.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the data set, the questions and answers, the code running and a walkthrough of the code.}
